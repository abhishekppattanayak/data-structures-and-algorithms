# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repository serves as my revision notes for the questions that I have solved/ will be solving on mainly two major platforms, LeetCode and Codeforces. 

Within each folder, there are subfolders, for individual problem statements, named using their unique `id` at their respective platforms. If subfolder is not present yet, it may be added soon in the near future. 

## Directory Structure

```
├── 
└──   LeetCode
    └──   #id
        ├──  README .md // has walkthrough
        └──  solution.cpp // entire code
    └── ...
└──  codeforces
    └──   #id
